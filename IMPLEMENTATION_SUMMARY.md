# Music Library SQLite Implementation Summary

## Overview
I've successfully reimplemented your Library and Audio classes to use SQLite instead of in-memory storage. The implementation leverages your existing well-designed database schema and provides enhanced functionality including scan session management and orphan cleanup.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Audio Class (`packages/api/src/audio.ts`)

**Core Changes:**
- **ID Management**: Changed from hash-based string IDs to SQLite auto-increment integer IDs
- **Content Hash**: Added `contentHash` property for duplicate detection using the existing `audioFileHash` function
- **Database Persistence**: Added `save()` method to persist tracks to SQLite with upsert logic
- **Normalization**: Implemented automatic handling of normalized entities (artists, albums, genres)
- **Loading**: Added static methods `loadById()` and `loadByContentHash()` to retrieve tracks from database

**New Methods:**
- `save()`: Saves or updates track in database with full normalization
- `saveNormalizedEntities()`: Handles artists, albums, and genres
- `getOrCreateArtist()`, `getOrCreateAlbum()`, `getOrCreateGenre()`: Utility methods for normalization
- `loadById()`: Static method to load track by ID
- `loadByContentHash()`: Static method to load track by content hash

### 2. Library Class (`packages/api/src/library.ts`)

**Core Changes:**
- **Storage**: Replaced in-memory Map with SQLite queries
- **Scan Sessions**: Added comprehensive scan session management with tracking
- **Orphan Cleanup**: Implemented automatic cleanup of tracks that no longer exist on disk
- **SQL Queries**: Replaced in-memory filtering/sorting with proper SQL queries
- **Progress Tracking**: Enhanced progress tracking with database statistics

**New Methods:**
- `getStats()`: Returns library statistics (total tracks, artists, albums, genres)
- `getArtists()`: Returns all artists with track counts
- `getAlbums()`: Returns all albums with track counts
- `createScanSession()`: Creates a new scan session for tracking
- `completeScanSession()`: Marks scan session as complete with statistics
- `recordTrackScan()`: Records that a track was seen during scanning
- `cleanupOrphanTracks()`: Removes tracks that weren't seen in the latest scan

**Enhanced Methods:**
- `getEntries()`: Now uses SQL queries with proper filtering, sorting, and pagination
- `getById()`: Loads tracks from database instead of memory
- `load()`: Enhanced with scan session management and orphan cleanup

## Database Schema Integration

The implementation fully utilizes your existing schema:

### Tables Used:
- **tracks**: Main track storage with both normalized and denormalized fields
- **artists**: Normalized artist data with MusicBrainz support
- **albums**: Normalized album data with artist relationships
- **genres**: Normalized genre data
- **trackArtists**: Many-to-many relationships for complex artist scenarios
- **scanSessions**: Tracks filesystem scan operations
- **trackScans**: Records which tracks were seen in each scan

### Key Features:
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses content hash for reliable duplicate detection
- **Denormalization**: Stores commonly queried fields directly in tracks table for performance
- **Scan Tracking**: Complete audit trail of filesystem scanning operations
- **Orphan Management**: Automatic cleanup of tracks that no longer exist on disk

## Benefits of the New Implementation

1. **Persistence**: Library data survives application restarts
2. **Performance**: SQL queries are more efficient than in-memory filtering
3. **Scalability**: Can handle much larger music libraries
4. **Reliability**: Comprehensive duplicate detection and orphan cleanup
5. **Auditability**: Full scan session tracking and statistics
6. **Normalization**: Proper relational data structure while maintaining query performance

## Database Setup

To use the new implementation:

1. **Environment**: Set `DATABASE_PATH` environment variable for the SQLite database location
2. **Migrations**: Run `drizzle-kit migrate` to create the database schema
3. **Import**: Your existing imports should work: `import { ... } from 'db'`, `import { ... } from 'db/schema'`

## API Compatibility

The public API remains largely compatible with your existing code:
- `library.load(paths)` still works the same way
- `library.getEntries({...})` has the same interface but now uses SQL
- `library.getById(id)` works the same but loads from database
- Added new methods like `getStats()`, `getArtists()`, `getAlbums()` for additional functionality

## Migration Notes

When you first run the new implementation:
1. It will scan your music library and populate the database
2. Existing tracks will be detected and won't be duplicated
3. The first scan may take longer as it builds the initial database
4. Subsequent scans will be faster as they only process new/changed files

The implementation is production-ready and should handle your music library efficiently with proper error handling and progress tracking.
